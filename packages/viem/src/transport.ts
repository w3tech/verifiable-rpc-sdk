// vrpcHttp — verifiable drop-in for viem's `http(url)` transport (Phase 31).
//
// A viem custom transport (built on `createTransport`) whose `request` owns its
// own `fetch`, captures the RAW content-decoded response bytes BEFORE
// `JSON.parse`, and feeds them — with the exact request bytes it POSTed — into
// vrpc-core's `verifyResponse` (the SAME seam the ethers `_send` override uses,
// PKG-05). Only after verification passes is the body parsed and the result
// returned. Verification is fail-closed by default (strict); permissive mode
// (opt-in) downgrades a `VerificationError` to one logged warning and passes the
// parsed body through. A signed JSON-RPC `{error}` body surfaces as viem's own
// `RpcRequestError` (NOT a VerificationError) so `buildRequest` maps it by code.
//
// HTTP-status parity (MD-01): mirrors the ethers `_send` override's
// `response.assertOk()` (provider.ts:87). An UNSIGNED non-2xx response (a bare
// gateway 502 / timeout error page with no `vRPC-*` headers) is a transport
// failure and throws viem's `HttpRequestError` BEFORE verify — so it reads as a
// network error, not a `MissingHeader` that looks like a verify attack. This
// does NOT weaken fail-closed: a SIGNED non-2xx body still flows into
// `verifyResponse` (its signed `{error}` surfaces as an ordinary RpcError), and
// an UNSIGNED 2xx body still reaches verify and fails closed with `MissingHeader`.
//
// Batching is OFF by default for v1: every action issues a single non-batched
// `{ id: 1 }` request that is verified as one unit (consistent with ETHERS-05 —
// VIEM-03). Batched-as-one-unit verification is a deferred opt-in.
//
// `retryCount: 0` is hardcoded and viem's injected default is ignored on purpose:
// `buildRequest` (viem utils/buildRequest.ts) treats a thrown VerificationError
// as a codeless non-HTTP error and would otherwise RETRY it 3× and re-wrap it as
// an UnknownRpcError, masking the verify failure. With retryCount:0 the typed
// error propagates; a full-client caller recovers it via
// `err.walk(e => e instanceof VerificationError)` since buildRequest preserves it
// as `.cause`.

/**
 * A viem `Transport` that Ed25519-verifies every HTTP JSON-RPC response over its
 * raw content-decoded bytes before the value reaches the client.
 *
 * Drop-in: `createPublicClient({ transport: vrpcHttp(url) })` substitutes for
 * `http(url)`. The chain id bound into the signed pre-image is OPTIONAL — omit
 * it and the transport lazily derives it from a SIGNED `eth_chainId` response on
 * the first request, verifying that signature self-consistently (the response's
 * own `result` IS the chainId, so it only verifies if the node really signed for
 * that chain). A tampered/forged/unsigned bootstrap fails FAST with a
 * `VerificationError`; there is no unverified fallback. Passing it explicitly —
 * `vrpcHttp(url, { chainId })` — is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED: it pins to YOUR
 * expected chain (catching a wrong-node / wrong-URL misconfig that auto-derive,
 * which trusts the node's self-reported chain, would not) and skips the
 * bootstrap round-trip. Every read (getBalance, readContract/call, getLogs,
 * getBlock, estimateGas, getTransactionReceipt, sendRawTransaction, …) funnels
 * through the single verifying `request`.
